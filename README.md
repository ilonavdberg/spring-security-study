# Spring Security Study

This project is a personal study and reference implementation of Spring Security.
It is based on concepts and practices explained in *[Spring Security: Start Here](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-start-here)* by *Laurentiu Spilca*, but goes beyond simply following the book.

The goal of this project is twofold:
- To deepen my understanding of Spring Security by implementing the security layer in a clean, structured way.
- To create a reusable reference project I can revisit when applying security in future Spring projects.

While inspired by the book, the implementation reflects my own design decisions, explorations, and thought process.

## Technical Highlights
- **Spring Boot + Spring Security**: Core setup for authentication and authorization.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained access restrictions across dummy business domains.
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Stateless security layer for API endpoints.
- **OAuth 2 Login**: Integration with an external identity provider for modern authentication.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized structure for clarity and future reusability.

> *Status: In progress* — this repository evolves as I implement each of the planned features and patterns from my Spring Security study.
